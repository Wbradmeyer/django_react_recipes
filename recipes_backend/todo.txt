Todo List:

- Add to Model
    - Add cooking instructions and ingredients/measures
    - add area and category
    - cook time? remove?
    - side by side fields for measure and ingredients on form
    - can add another, increment the # at the end of the key
    - ingredients/measures data
        - could make this a TextField and one string divided by a character, when displayed
            I could split into a list by that character
        - otherwise store as a list or dictionaries, JSONField?
        - maybe copy the API data, 20 measures and 20 ingredients, some are empty or null
